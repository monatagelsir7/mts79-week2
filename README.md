# Data Engineering Systems Course - Week 2

Welcome to the repository for the second week of the Data Engineering Systems course at Duke University. 

## Overview
## Project Overview

This project leverages a template developed last week [mts79-week1](https://github.com/nogibjj/mts79-week1), which includes essential tools and configurations to streamline the development process. The template provides a standardized setup, including predefined environments and useful scripts for quick project initialization.

Additionally, this project utilizes the **Diamond Dataset** to perform descriptive statistics using **Pandas**. It generates a comprehensive summary report, offering insights into the dataset's key attributes and statistical measures.

## Contents

- **.devcontainer**: Configuration for a consistent development environment.
- **Makefile**: Automation of common tasks and commands.
- **.github**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required for the project.
